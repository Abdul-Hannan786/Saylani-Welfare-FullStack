    question: "How does HealthMate analyze my medical reports?",
    answer:
      "HealthMate uses Google's powerful Gemini AI model. You simply upload a PDF or image of your report, and Gemini reads it directlyâ€”no manual typing needed. It then generates an easy-to-understand summary in both English and Roman Urdu.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my health data safe and private?",
    answer:
      "Yes, absolutely. We use JWT-based authentication, encrypt user data, and provide signed URLs for file access. Your health information is stored securely and privately. We also include a clear disclaimer that AI is for understanding only, not for medical advice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track my health without lab reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes! HealthMate allows you to manually add vital signs like Blood Pressure, Sugar levels, Weight, and notes. This helps you maintain a complete health timeline even between formal lab tests.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of reports can HealthMate read?",
    answer:
      "HealthMate can read various medical documents, including lab reports, prescriptions, X-ray summaries, and ultrasound reports. As long as it's a clear PDF or image, Gemini can process it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does HealthMate replace my doctor?",
    answer:
      "No. HealthMate is designed to help you understand your health information better, but it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. We always recommend consulting your doctor for diagnosis and treatment. The app even suggests questions to ask your doctor during your visit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the app available in Urdu?",
    answer:
      "Yes! HealthMate provides all AI-generated summaries and explanations in both English and Roman Urdu, making it accessible for users who are more comfortable reading Urdu in the Roman script.",
